Problem statement:

We need to create following services in AWS for 4 different envs, which are dev, qa, uat & prod:

VPC - 2 public and 2 private subnets
5 EC2 servers
1 ALB
1 RDS

what is the ideal approach that a devops engineer should take?

the state should stored at a remote location / preferably S3 with state locking enable


Ans:

We will take the modular approach here,

Meaning we will create a terraform module and overwrite the configuration basis each env's req.

Steps:

1.) Create modules
2.) Call modules
3.) Define Remote state backend
4.) define env specific folders with tfvars and backend tfvars
5.) execute the code
