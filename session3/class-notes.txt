DevOps 1:

    terraform init

    terraform plan

    terraform apply - the infra got created

    scenario 1:

    terraform.tfstate was created inside our local folder in our laptops

    the state of this infra is only stored in my local dir

    scanerio 2: 

    terraform.tfstate was created inside our local folderbut synced to a remote shared location

    scenario 3:

    DevOp 1 is trying to execute the terraform code

    state locking feature -> lock the state file

DevOps 2: picks up the same code

    terraform apply 

    scenario 1:

    Does not have access to the terraform.tfstate file kep in devops 1 local filesystem

    Terraform will not be able to understand the state

    it will attempt to create the entire infra again and fail

    scenario 2:

    terraform will 1st sync or fetch the state file from the remote location and check the current status

    terraform will say that nothing to apply

    scenario 3:

    DevOp 2 is trying to execute the terraform code at the same time of devops 1

    error message saying state is locked wait for the earlier execution to complete


Q.1.) How do you identify which subnet is a private subnet and which is a public subnet in AWS VPC

VPC -> Subnet -> Associated with Route Tables

Public Subnets (1-3 or more) -> 1 Route Table which is a public Route

Private Subnets (1-3 or more) -> 1 Route Table which is a private Route
